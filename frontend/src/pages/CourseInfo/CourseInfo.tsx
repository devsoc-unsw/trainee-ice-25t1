            <h2>Course Outline</h2>
            <p> This course introduces students to how
                computer systems are structured in terms of
                basic electronic components, how they are
                used to implement procedural programs, and how they are structured as a collection of software layers. It introduces students to low-level software layers such as operating systems, and introduces concurrency concepts. The goal is
                to give students a solid understanding of what happens when high-level programs are executed, as a basis for
                further study in important areas of  computing such as computer architecture, operating systems.</p>
